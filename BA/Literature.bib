	abstract = {Many studies have stated that the break of breath holding is brought on when hypercapnic and hypoxic stimulations that urge respiration overcomevoluntary efforts to resist them, and several diagrams have been published to indicate the relationship between alveolar tensions of oxygen and carbondioxide at the breaking point1,6,12,17). This relationship has been described to be modified by neural factors, such as pulmonary vagal afferents3,15) and pro-prioceptive afferents from respiratory muscles7,18).The Po2-Pco2 relationship at the breaking point markedly varies if the breath is held with varied concentrations of O2, N2 and CO2 in the inspiredgas, even though the initial neural conditions, such as body posture and lungvolume, are kept unchanged. From this finding KOBAYASI and TAKAGI14) andTAKAGI and KOBAYASI19) derived the importance of the time factor in CO2stimulation, which concerns the determinationof the breaking point. On the other hand, there have been reports which emphasize a close rela-tionship between respiratory distress sensation and movements of the thorax and lungs. One example is the fact reported by FOWLER7) that if a subject, after a voluntary breath holding of maximal duration, rebreathes several times a gas mixture which does not improve the alveolar gas composition, a sufficient relief from distress is afforded, so that he can hold his breath for two additional periods despite a progressive decrease in the alveolar O2 ten-sion and a progressive increase in the alveolar CO2 tension. Another example is the observation that rebreathing can be continued longer than breath holding and alveolar gas tensions at the breaking point are lower for O2 and higher for CO2 than those in breath holding10,16). It is the purpose of this paper to present characteristics of the time factor in CO2 stimulation on respiration and the effects of respiratory muscleactivities and thorax movements on the termination of breath holding andrebreathing},
