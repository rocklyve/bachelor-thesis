	title = {Cardiac and Respiratory Parameter Estimation Using Head-mounted Motion-sensitive Sensors},
	abstract = {This work explores the feasibility of using motion-sensitive sensors embedded in Google Glass, a head-mounted wearable device, to robustly measure physiological signals of the wearer. In particular, we develop new methods to use Glassís accelerometer, gyroscope, and camera to extract pulse and respiratory waves of 12 participants during a controlled experiment. We show it is possible to achieve a mean absolute error of 0.82 beats per minute ({STD}: 1.98) for heart rate and 0.6 breaths per minute ({STD}: 1.19) for respiration rate when considering different observation windows and combinations of sensors. Moreover, we show that a head-mounted gyroscope sensor shows improved performance versus more commonly explored sensors such as accelerometers and demonstrate that a head-mounted camera is a novel and promising method to capture the physiological responses of the wearer. These findings included testing across sitting, supine, and standing postures before and after physical exercise.},

	abstract = {State-of-the-art respiration tracking devices require specialized equipment, making them impractical for every day at-home respiration sensing. In this paper, we present the first system for sensing respiratory rates using in-ear headphone inertial measurement units ({IMU}). The approach is based on technology already available in commodity devices: the {eSense} headphones. Our processing pipeline combines several existing approaches to clean noisy data and calculate respiratory rates on 20-second windows. In a study with twelve participants, we compare accelerometer and gyroscope based sensing and employ pressure-based measurement with nasal cannulas as ground truth. Our results indicate a mean absolute error of 2.62 {CPM} (acc) and 2.55 {CPM} (gyro). This overall accuracy is comparable to previous approaches using accelerometer-based sensing, but we observe a higher relative error for the gyroscope. In contrast to related work using other sensor positions, we can not report significant differences between the two modalities or the three postures standing, sitting, and lying on the back (supine). However, in general, performance varies drastically between participants.},

	abstract = {Central sleep apnea ({CSA}) is a serious condition most commonly seen in patients with heart failure (heart failure refers to the inability of the heart to adequately pump blood and oxygen around the body, often caused by enlarged, stiffened and damaged heart chambers). 30-80\% of patients with heart failure have central sleep apnea. Therefore, many attempts have been made to produce a monitoring system for automatic Central Sleep Apnea scoring to reduce clinical efforts. This paper describes a method for detection of Central Sleep Apnea using signals obtained from an accelerometer sensor placed on the patient's chest and a Multilayer Perceptron network ({MLP}). Results show that a minute-by-minute classification accuracy of over 84\% is achievable.},

	title = {Rumor Detection on Social Media with Bi-Directional Graph Convolutional Networks},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06362},
	abstract = {Social media has been developing rapidly in public due to its nature of spreading new information, which leads to rumors being circulated. Meanwhile, detecting rumors from such massive information in social media is becoming an arduous challenge. Therefore, some deep learning methods are applied to discover rumors through the way they spread, such as Recursive Neural Network ({RvNN}) and so on. However, these deep learning methods only take into account the patterns of deep propagation but ignore the structures of wide dispersion in rumor detection. Actually, propagation and dispersion are two crucial characteristics of rumors. In this paper, we propose a novel bi-directional graph model, named Bi-Directional Graph Convolutional Networks (Bi-{GCN}), to explore both characteristics by operating on both top-down and bottom-up propagation of rumors. It leverages a {GCN} with a top-down directed graph of rumor spreading to learn the patterns of rumor propagation, and a {GCN} with an opposite directed graph of rumor diffusion to capture the structures of rumor dispersion. Moreover, the information from the source post is involved in each layer of {GCN} to enhance the influences from the roots of rumors. Encouraging empirical results on several benchmarks confirm the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art approaches.},
